    <div id="basic"><h2>Stage 0: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
      </div>
    <div id="web_page"><h3>What a Web Page is<br></h3>
      <p>A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="coding"><h3>How Coding Works</h3>
      <p> Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. I'm <b>learning</b> to code! </p>
      </div>
    <div id="stupid"><h3>Computers are Stupid</h3>
       <p>Programmers need to write <em>exactly</em> the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax"). </p>
      </div>
    <div id="programmers"><h3>Programmers Can't Remember Everything</h3>
       <p><a href="http://www.clker.com/clipart-sad-computer-1.html"></a> There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up. </p>
      </div>     
    <div id="basic_html"><h3>Basic HTML Vocabulary</h3>
      <p><b>Tag:</b> An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets.<br><b>	Element:</b> An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.<br><b>	Attribute:</b> This is a property of an HTML element.  </p>
      </div>
    <div id="web_doc_str"><h2>Stage 1: Webpages, Documents, and Structure</h2>
      </div>   
    <div id="html_java_css"><h3>HTML, JavaScript, and CSS</h3>
      <p>HTML represents the <em>structure</em> of a webpage, JavaScript is for <em>interactive components</em>, and CSS adds <em>styles</em>. </p>
      </div>
    <div id="dom"><h3>DOM (Document Object Model)</h3>
      <p>DOM is a tree-like stucture of a page, where every tage is an element in a tree.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="box"><h3>Indentations and Boxes</h3>
      <p>It's useful to start looking at every webpage from the perspective of "seeing boxes". E.g., every header on this very page is a box, every text paragraph is a a box.<br></p>
      </div>
    <div id="language"><img src="http://www.utne.com/~/media/Images/UTR/Editorial/Articles/Magazine%20Articles/2012/05-01/Code%20Year%20Get%20With%20the%20Computer%20Programming/Computer-Programming.jpg" alt="computer language">
      </div>
    <div id="image_description">Our new language.
      </div>      
    <div id="css"><h3>CSS</h3>
      <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The most important rule we should remember is inheritance rule: the most specific rule is applied to every element.<br>Here is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">link</a> if you need to reference any CSS property.</p>
      </div>
       <p>Every box consists of the following elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Margin (clears the area around the border)<br>
          <li>Border<br>
          <li>Padding (clears the area around the content)<br>
          <li>Content (nucleus of the box; like this text inside it's "paragraph" box)
        </ul>
    <div id="box"><h3>The Box Model</h3>
       <p>If you would like to make a box flexible (for better alignment of elements on a page), you need to add "display: flex" in the CSS code. Some CSS Tricks may be found <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox">here</a>.</p>
      </div>
    <div id="code_test"><h3>Code, Test,       
        Refine</h3>  
      <p>This is a routine we all should follow while designing a page:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Look for natural boxes.
          <li>Look for repeates styles and semantic elements.
          <li>Write HTML.
          <li>Apply styles (from biggest to smallest).
          <li>Fix and adjust things.
      </ol>
     <div id="avoid_rep"><h3>Avoiding Repetition</h3>
       <p>When programmers <em>don't</em> avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.</p>
     </div> 
      <p>Final step, don't forget to validate your code:
      <br><a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">HTML Validator</a>
      <br><a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">CSS Validator</a></p>
